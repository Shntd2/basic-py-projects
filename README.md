Place for new Python projects

### Completed projects:
* Color mixer (colorizer.py). This project produces a new color as a result of mixing RGB basic colors: 
    * The user chooses what needs to be done with colors by himself - addition or subtraction 
    * Then user should choose what two of basic RGB colors to add or subtract
    * In result code will output combined color: 
        * In tuple format with three digits in it - containing level of red, green and blue 
        * In hexadecimal format
        * Will generate PNG image of new color thanks to `Image` of `PIL` module
